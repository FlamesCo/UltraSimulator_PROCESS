Introduction
Welcome to the UltraSimulator repository! This project is dedicated to emulating the Nintendo Ultra Simulator (UltraSim), a proprietary emulator created by Silicon Graphics in mid-1995 for the Nintendo 64. Our goal is to recreate the functionality of UltraSim using modern technology, providing developers and enthusiasts a tool to explore and understand this crucial part of gaming history.

UltraSim was known for its comprehensive simulation capabilities, including algorithm simulation, I/O simulation, co-simulation, and more, aiming for fast, bit-accurate, and clock-accurate emulation.

Features
Emulation of the original Nintendo Ultra Simulator (UltraSim).
Bit-accurate and clock-accurate simulations.
Supports algorithm, I/O, and co-simulation.
